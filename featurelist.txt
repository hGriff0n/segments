Display segments on 3d map
Display information on segments on hover (maybe have clickable icons)
Display pop out of segments indicating more detailed information (ala veloviewer?)
Be able to display gradient as a coloring
Create route between segments

PLAN:
display set path
attach 3d marker to path
attach hover behavior to marker
get paths from strava data
create paths on map
work on getting ui as desired
-- plan next steps
