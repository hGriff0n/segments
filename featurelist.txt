X Display segments on 3d map
~ Display information on segments on hover (maybe have clickable icons)
Display pop out of segments indicating more detailed information (ala veloviewer?)
~ Be able to display gradient as a coloring
Create route between segments
Route collections?
  will likely need to figure out strava oauth

PLAN:
attach 3d marker to path
create paths on map
work on getting ui as desired
  improve hover behavior (embellish line, add info)
  add expanded click view
-- plan next steps

electron:serve doesn't work for some reason

REWORK APP
More full featured route storage/planning functionality
Better strava activity/segment functionality
Zwift/VR Integration?
